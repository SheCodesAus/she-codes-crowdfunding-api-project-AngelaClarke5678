# DRF Crowdfunding API Project
**Contributi** is a local government area community fundraising platform for members of the community to fundraise for projects specifically for their local community. During COVID lockdowns we discovered that a strong local community is what helped to keep people happy and engaged. Contributi enables community members to connect and fund the local projects most important to them.
